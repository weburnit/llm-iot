# Training model with IOT device

Here is a summary of the main aspects of the Trainer class:

## Initialization:
At the start, the trainer is initialized with a model, tokenizer, and datasets (all set to None). There are also placeholders for LoRA configurations and paths to data files.

## Data Loading and Preparation:
The load_data and prepare_dataset functions are used to load the data from specified feather files and a metadata file. The data is then prepared by splitting it into training, validation, and test sets.

## Model Training:
The train function first loads the data, then prepares the model for k-bit training (a procedure presumably provided by the PEFT library). The function also configures a training directory, sets up the training arguments, and creates a transformers.Trainer instance. Finally, the model is trained and the result is returned.

## Model Generation:
The generate function uses the loaded model and tokenizer to generate a response to a given prompt.

## From the class I have learnt about:

* How to load and prepare data for a sequence-to-sequence machine learning model.
* How to train a model using the Transformers library and additional optimization techniques.

# Missing part
* Didn't accelerate to speed up training
